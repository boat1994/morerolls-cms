# 🎬 Morerolls Studio: Content Management Manual

Welcome to your new Content Management System (CMS)! This guide is designed to help you manage your website's content easily and effectively. No technical knowledge required!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

When you log in to the admin panel, you'll see a sidebar on the left. This is your control center. It's divided into two main sections:

1. **Collections**: Think of these as "folders" for items that you have many of (like Projects or Services).
2. **Globals**: These are "one-off" settings for specific pages (like your "About Us" page or site-wide social links).

## 🖼️ 1. Managing Your Media Library

Before adding projects or editing pages, you'll often need to upload images or videos.

### How to add media:

1. Go to **Media** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create New**.
3. **Upload**: Select your file.
4. **Alt Text**: **(Important!)** Describe what's in the image. This helps search engines (SEO) and people who use screen readers.
   - _Example: "Cinematographer filming a commercial on a beach."_

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Image Size**: For best results, use high-quality JPG or PNG files. For the "Services" thumbnails, a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio looks best.

## 📂 2. Managing Your Portfolio (Projects)

This is where you showcase your work.

### Adding a New Project:

- **Title**: The name of the project.
- **URL snippet (Slug)**: This is the part of the web address unique to this project. It will auto-generate from the title, but you can change it in the sidebar.
- **Client**: Name of the company or person you worked for.
- **Year**: When the project took place.
- **Services**: A short list of what you did (e.g., _Event Coverage, Final Editing_).
- **Description**: Tell the story of the project.
- **Video Source URL**: If the video is on YouTube or Vimeo, paste the link here.
- **Poster**: Choose a high-quality cover image for the project from your Media Library.

## 💰 3. Managing Services & Packages

This section controls the pricing and service details shown to your clients.

### Key Fields:

- **Package Title**: The name of the service (e.g., _Short Video Content_).
- **Category**: Choose where this service belongs (e.g., _Advertisement_).
- **Thumbnail**: The main image representing this service.
- **Highlight**: A very short "hook" or summary (Max 120 characters).
- **Recommended For**: Describe who this package is perfect for (e.g., _"Event organizers wanting quick recap videos"_).
- **Price Configuration**:
  - **Amount**: The price (numbers only).
  - **Unit**: How you charge (e.g., _per Project_, _per Month_).
  - **Show "Starts at"**: Check this box if the price is a base rate that might go up.
- **Technical Specs**: A list of technical details (e.g., _Duration: 30 Seconds_, _Resolution: 4K_).

## 🌐 4. Editing Your Pages (Globals)

### 🏠 Home Page (Root Page Medias)

Control the most visual parts of your landing page.

- **Hero Video**: You can choose to **Upload** a video directly or use a **YouTube** link.
  - **Mobile vs. Desktop**: You can set different videos for phones and computers so the site stays fast and look great on all devices!
- **Client Logos**: A list of logos for the brands you've worked with. (Recommended: Use square 1:1 ratio images for these).

### 📖 About Us Page

- **Hero Section**: The big opening statement. You can change the main headline and the background image here.
- **Our Philosophy**: Describe the "logic" behind your work.
- **Founder Spotlight**: Shine a light on the people behind the studio. You can set the name, role, bio, and a portrait image.
- **Our Standards**: A section to highlight 3-4 key principles or standards of your work with icons.

### 📞 Contact Page

- **Main Headline**: The greeting people see on your contact page.
- **Email & Phone**: Your primary contact details.
- **Visit Us**: You can choose to show or hide your physical address using the checkbox.

### ⚙️ General Settings

- **Footer Text**: The copyright text at the very bottom of every page.
- **Social Media Links**: Add your Instagram, LinkedIn, or Facebook links here. Just give it a name (Label) and paste the URL.

## ✅ Best Practices for Content Editors

- **Always Preview**: If your system supports it, check how things look before hit "Save".
- **Consistency is Key**: Try to keep project titles and descriptions similar in length/tone.
- **Keep Slugs Short**: Avoid long complicated URLs. `my-awesome-video` is better than `my-awesome-video-filmed-in-bangkok-2024`.
- **Clean Media**: Only keep images you are actually using to keep the system organized.
